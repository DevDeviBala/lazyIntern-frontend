        Why We Started lazyIntern
      </h2>
      <div className="text-lg text-gray-600 space-y-4">
        <p>
          Too many brilliant students with incredible coding skills and
          innovative projects were being overlooked simply because they
          didn't attend top-tier universities or maintain perfect GPAs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, companies were struggling to find genuinely talented
          developers who could contribute from day one. The traditional
          hiring process was failing both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          lazyIntern was born from the belief that{" "}
          <strong>
            what you can build matters more than where you studied
          </strong>
          . We created a platform where students can showcase their real
          projects and companies can discover talent based on actual skills.
